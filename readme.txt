Artisteer Custom Sidebar Generator can create as many sidebars as you need. Specify a sidebar using the new sidebar shortcode.

== Description ==

Now you can create as many sidebars as you need for any page you want in your [Artisteer v3.1](http://artisteer.com/ "Artisteer") generated theme with the Artisteer Custom Sidebar Generator. Specify a sidebar using the new sidebar shortcode. The shortcode can be used in any page or post to display the sidebar of your choice with the widgets of your choice. You can also use the standard Artisteer theme sidebar template tag to place a custom sidebar wherever you want in your theme files. If you have the [Templateer](http://thetemplateer.com/ "Templateer") add-on for Artisteer then you can have even more options by replacing the primary and secondary sidebars with any other sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will it work with any theme? =

No. Only themes created with the Artisteer design program v3.1.0.x. Using it with any other themes will cause major galactic destruction.

= How do you generate a sidebar? =

Once the plugin is active, go to Appearance>Custom Sidebars. Only your generated sidebars will display on this page, your theme's sidebars are still active and working, they just don't show because they are not generated by this plugin.

= What happens to the widgets assigned to a custom sidebar if I delete it? =

When you delete a custom sidebar all of the widgets that are present will also be deleted. So make sure you save any special settings in the widgets before deleting the sidebar.

= How do I include the custom sidebar in my page template file? =

Just include the following code in your theme file where you want the new sidebar to appear.

    <?php theme_dynamic_sidebar('sidebar-name'); ?>
